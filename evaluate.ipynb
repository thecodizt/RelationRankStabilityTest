    "IN CONTEXT: International trade involves complex producer-consumer relationships between countries. Various goods and materials flow across borders.\n",
    "\n",
    "TASK: I am tasked with estimating the likelihood of a producer-consumer relationship between two given countries in terms of semiconductors.\n",
    "\n",
    "INSTRUCTIONS:\n",
    "\n",
    "Input: I will receive two countries (e.g., China, United States) as input.\n",
    "Process: Analyze the countries and their known roles in the global semiconductor industry. Consider factors like:\n",
    "Specialization: Is one country known for producing raw materials (e.g., rare earth metals) or finished semiconductor products (e.g., integrated circuits)?\n",
    "Trade Patterns: Are there established trade routes for semiconductor-related goods between these countries?\n",
    "Prioritize Speed: While maintaining some accuracy is important, prioritize providing a quick, approximate score.\n",
    "\n",
    "Output: Generate a score between 0 and 1, where:\n",
    "\n",
    "0 indicates no producer-consumer relationship is likely.\n",
    "1 indicates a high likelihood of a well-established producer-consumer relationship.\n",
    "No Reasoning Required:  This task does not require justification or detailed explanation. Focus solely on generating the score.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "Input: Country 1: South Korea | Country 2: Vietnam\n",
    "\n",
    "Output: 0.7 (This is an approximate score without reasoning.)\n",
    "\n",
    "Additional Considerations:\n",
    "\n",
    "You can access and process external knowledge sources if readily available (but prioritize speed).\n",
    "Remember: The goal is to quickly estimate the likelihood of a producer-consumer relationship for semiconductors based on the provided countries and your understanding of global trade patterns.\n",

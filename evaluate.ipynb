    "BASE_PROMPT = \"TASK: You are tasked with estimating the likelihood of a producer-consumer relationship between two given countries in terms of semiconductors. Input: I will receive two countries (e.g., China, United States) as input. Process: Analyze the countries and their known roles in the global semiconductor industry. Output: Generate a score between 0 and 1, where: 0 indicates no producer-consumer relationship is likely. 1 indicates a high likelihood of a well-established producer-consumer relationship. No Reasoning Required: This task does not require justification or explanation. Focus solely on generating the score. Example: Input: Country: South Korea Country: Vietnam Output: 0.7 Remember: The goal is to quickly estimate the likelihood of a producer-consumer relationship for semiconductors based on the provided countries and your understanding of global trade patterns.\""

The country has a strong domestic market for these products and has been investing heavily in research and development to support its semiconductor industry. However, India is also a significant consumer of semiconductors, importing various types of integrated circuits ICs and electronic components from countries like South Korea, Taiwan, Japan, and the United States. 2. The UAE, on the other hand, has been developing its semiconductor industry in recent years, with notable companies such as Samsung Electronics and Intel operating manufacturing facilities in the country. The UAE also serves as a hub for global trade, attracting various types of semiconductors from different countries to meet the demands of its growing electronics market. 3. While there is potential for the UAE to become a consumer of semiconductors produced by India, it is not yet a significant importer of these products. The two countries have relatively small economies and limited connections in the global semiconductor industry, making a strong producer-consumer relationship unlikely at this time.

According to the Semiconductor Industry Association SIA, in 2020, China accounted for 17 of the worlds total semiconductor production, while India accounted for less than 1. However, Indias demand for semiconductors has been growing rapidly due to its expanding electronics manufacturing sector.  Chinas strong position in the global semiconductor market is supported by its large domestic market, extensive supply chain, and government support for the industry. The country has invested heavily in research and development RD and has established itself as a hub for chip design, manufacturing, and testing.  India, on the other hand, has been rapidly increasing its semiconductor production capacity in recent years, with several domestic companies setting up manufacturing facilities. While Indias share of global semiconductor production is still relatively small, the countrys growing demand for chips and increasing investment in RD suggest that it could become a significant player in the industry in the future.  Based on these factors, the likelihood of a producer-consumer relationship between China and India in the semiconductor market is relatively high. While China is currently the leading producer, Indias growing demand and investment in the industry could potentially lead to a more balanced relationship in the future.\", 28.79224419593811);\n",

Heres why:  Hong Kong is a major semiconductor manufacturing hub, with companies like Intel, AMD, and Texas Instruments operating there. Hong Kongs strategic location and well-developed infrastructure make it an attractive place for companies to set up manufacturing facilities. The country also has a highly skilled workforce and a pro-business environment, which helps to attract foreign investment.  On the other hand, the United Arab Emirates UAE is a relatively small player in the global semiconductor market, with limited domestic production. However, the UAE does have a number of specialized semiconductor companies that operate in the country, such as Global Foundries and Gulf Advanced Technology Services GATS. These companies primarily serve the regional market, but they may also export to other countries in the Middle East and beyond.  While there is some scope for collaboration or joint ventures between Hong Kong and the UAE in the semiconductor sector, it is unlikely that these two countries will form a strong producer-consumer relationship. The UAEs limited domestic production means that it is largely reliant on imports from other countries, including Hong Kong. Additionally, the UAEs strategic location in the Middle East makes it more likely to serve as a transshipment hub for semiconductors produced in other regions, rather than as a major producer itself.  In summary, while there may be some potential for collaboration between Hong Kong and the UAE in the semiconductor sector, the likelihood of a strong producer-consumer relationship is relatively low due to the UAEs limited domestic production and reliance on imports from other countries.\", 36.548511266708374);\n",

Heres why:  1. China is one of the worlds largest producers of semiconductors, accounting for a significant share of global production. It has a well-established industry with numerous manufacturers, including state-owned companies like Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corporation SMIC and Taiwanese companies like Hon Hai Precision Industry Co., Ltd Foxconn. 2. India is a growing market for semiconductors, with increasing demand from the technology sector. However, it lags behind in domestic production, relying heavily on imports to meet its demand. This creates an opportunity for China to supply India with semiconductors, given their proximity and established trade relations. 3. China has been actively promoting its Belt and Road Initiative BRI, which aims to enhance regional connectivity and economic cooperation. As part of this initiative, China has invested in infrastructure projects in India, including the development of special economic zones for electronics manufacturing. This could lead to increased trade between the two countries, with China supplying semiconductors to Indian companies. 4. The Indian government has set ambitious targets for the domestic production of semiconductors, recognizing the strategic importance of this industry. However, it is unlikely that India will be able to achieve these targets in the near term, given the technical and capital-intensive nature of semiconductor manufacturing. This creates an opportunity for China to fill the gap in the short term, as Indias demand for semiconductors continues to grow.  Based on these factors, there is a high likelihood that China will establish a producer-consumer relationship with India in the semiconductor industry.\", 35.75189232826233);\n",
